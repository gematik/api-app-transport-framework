# API App Transport Framework (ATF) FHIR-Profiles

The ATF (App-Transport-Framework) is an open and independent framework designed to improve the efficiency of communication in medical services. It is based on structured data exchange using FHIR standards and aims to optimize communication through standardization and partial automation.

The profiles in this repository serve as a foundation for various use cases where medical data is exchanged via messaging services like KIM and TIM. The framework allows for automation of messaging processes without manual intervention, ensuring that messages are processed reliably and consistently.

## Key Features

- **Open Framework**: The ATF is not restricted to specific use cases and can be applied flexibly across different domains.
- **FHIR-Based Communication**: Uses FHIR standards for structured and standardized communication between medical systems.
- **Decentralized and Scalable**: Supports both centralized and decentralized communication, making it adaptable for various medical settings like hospitals, pharmacies, and laboratories.
- **Layered OSI Model Integration**: The ATF operates primarily in the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, defining how messages are structured and processed.
- **Partial Automation**: Designed to enable partial automation of message exchanges, reducing the need for manual interaction and improving efficiency.

## About the Project

This repository contains FHIR Shorthand (FSH) files that will later be published on [Simplifier](https://simplifier.net/app-transport-framework). These files define the structure and implementation details for the ATF, supporting use cases like prescription requests, patient records management, and more.

### Project Goals

- **Structured Medical Communication**: Improve the flow of information between healthcare providers.
- **Automation of Processes**: Automate repetitive tasks and minimize manual intervention in messaging workflows.
- **Enhanced Interoperability**: Promote interoperability between different healthcare systems using FHIR and open standards.
